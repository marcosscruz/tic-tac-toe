# Tic-Tac-Toe Implementations in Different Programming Languages

This repository contains simple implementations of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game in various programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. The goal is to showcase how the same game can be created in different languages, enabling a comparison between them.

## Implementations

### C++

- [Tic-Tac-Toe in C++](cpp/tic-tac-toe.cpp): C++ implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, where two players can play on the same computer.

<!-- ### Java

- [Tic-Tac-Toe in Java](java/TicTacToe.java): Java implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with a simple graphical interface.

### Python

- [Tic-Tac-Toe in Python](python/tic_tac_toe.py): Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with a terminal interface.

### JavaScript

- [Tic-Tac-Toe in JavaScript](javascript/tic_tac_toe.js): JavaScript implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe that can be run in web browsers. -->

## How to Run

Each implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe has its own execution instructions. You can find specific details in the directories of each language mentioned above. Make sure to have the appropriate development environment set up for the respective language.

## Contributions
