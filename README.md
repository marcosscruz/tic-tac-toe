# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

## Description

This repository contains a simple and functional implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as "Noughts and Crosses," is a strategy game for two players where the goal is to fill three consecutive spaces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with your symbol (X or O).

## Key Features

- Play the Tic-Tac-Toe game against a human opponent on the same computer.
- Player switching and checking for victory or a draw.
- Display the game board on the screen to track the game's progress.
- Option to play again after the end of a match.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code (the .cpp file) using a compatible C++ compiler.
3. Run the game in the terminal or command prompt.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.

Feel free to explore and customize this source code to add additional features or improve the user interface. It's a great project for students looking to practice C++ programming concepts or simply have fun with a classic game!

**Note:** Ensure that you have a C++ development environment set up on your system before running the game. Due to the code having certain library imports related to the WIndowns operating system, it is likely that it will not work on another operating system.
